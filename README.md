I build backend systems, internal services, and the platform foundations that keep products stable as they grow.
My focus is on clarity, long-term structure, and decisions that reduce complexity instead of feeding it.

At Append, I work on identity, service orchestration, CI/CD, and the core application layer behind our products.
I care about how systems behave under pressure, how teams interact with the code they inherit, and how architecture shapes the velocity of a company.

I avoid unnecessary abstraction, prefer simple constructs with strong boundaries, and design for long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

Right now, I’m focused on platform architecture and backend design — building a base that can scale without losing stability.
