## 🧩 COO & Backend Engineer at **Append**

I spend most of my time building backend systems that are practical, scalable, and clear enough to grow without becoming chaotic.  
Most of my hands-on work involves **.NET**, **Node.js**, and **SQL Server**, but what interests me goes beyond the stack itself.

> **I’m interested in how ideas become architecture**   
> how an abstract problem turns into something shapeable, designable, and eventually reliable.

## 🛠️ What I’m building

At Append, I work on defining and strengthening:

- the internal service layer  
- the Identity system  
- and the core foundations behind our upcoming SaaS platforms  

My role moves between engineering and strategic thinking —  
understanding what we need now, what we’ll need later,  
and how to design something that supports both without premature complexity.

## 🎛️ How I approach systems

I pay close attention to:

- how systems age  
- how teams interact with what they inherit  
- how early decisions can determine future flexibility  
- and where complexity truly comes from  

I enjoy the invisible parts of software:  
the boundaries, the flows, the constraints and affordances that hold everything together when things scale.

> **Good systems feel intentional.**  
> Not rigid, not chaotic — just well-designed paths that keep evolving when needed.

## 🎨 Structure + creativity

Structure matters to me.  
Creativity matters to me just as much.

Some of the best decisions come from:

- challenging assumptions  
- exploring unconventional approaches  
- or discovering a simpler path that wasn’t obvious at first  

I see engineering as a blend of reasoning, intuition, and adaptability —  
the willingness to redesign when the context changes, instead of forcing old patterns to fit new realities.

## 🚧 Current focus

Right now, my work centers on backend and platform architecture — building foundations that guide how Append will scale technically, without fossilizing too early.

> **Good architecture isn’t static.**  
> It adapts when it must, and protects what should remain stable.

### 🧱 **Designing structures, not patches**  
…but always open to new ideas when they genuinely strengthen the system.
