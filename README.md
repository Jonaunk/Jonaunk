## 🧩 COO & Backend Engineer at **Append**

I work mainly on backend systems using **.NET**, **Node.js**, and **SQL Server**.  
I like building things that are clear, stable, and easy to maintain over time.

At Append, I’m involved in the internal service layer, the Identity system, and the early foundations of the SaaS products we’re building.  
My work sits somewhere between writing code and making decisions that help the platform grow in a reasonable way.

I pay attention to how systems behave as they grow and how teams interact with the code they inherit.  
I try to keep things simple, avoid unnecessary complexity, and pick solutions that make sense in the long run.

I care about structure, but I also enjoy trying new ideas when they solve a problem better.

Right now, my focus is backend and platform architecture — keeping the core stable while we continue improving and expanding the system.

### 🧱 **Designing structures, not patches.**
