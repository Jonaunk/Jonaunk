## 🧩 COO & Backend Engineer at **Append**

I spend most of my time building backend systems that are practical, scalable, and clear enough to grow without becoming chaotic.  
Most of my work involves **.NET**, **Node.js**, and **SQL Server**, but what interests me goes beyond the tools themselves.  
I’m drawn to the moment when an idea starts turning into architecture — when a problem stops being abstract and becomes shapeable, designable, and eventually real.

## 🛠️ What I’m working on
At Append, I’m helping shape:

- our internal service layer  
- our Identity system  
- and the foundations for the SaaS platforms we’re building  

My role sits between engineering and long-term thinking:  
understanding what we need today, what we might need in a year, and how to design something that can support both without forcing premature complexity.

## 🎛️ How I think about systems
I pay close attention to how systems age, how teams interact with the structures they inherit, and how early decisions influence flexibility years later.

I enjoy the parts of software people rarely see:  
the boundaries, the flows, the quiet pieces of logic that hold everything together under pressure.

I value thoughtful engineering — not just clean code, but code that *understands* what it’s trying to solve.  
To me, good systems feel intentional: the result of awareness, not habit.

## 🎨 Structure *and* creativity
Creativity matters to me as much as structure.  
Some of the best solutions come from:

- rethinking assumptions  
- exploring unconventional ideas  
- or discovering a simpler path that wasn’t obvious at first  

I see engineering as a mix of reasoning, intuition, and the willingness to redesign when context changes.

## 🚧 Current focus
Right now my work centers on backend and platform architecture — building foundations that will support Append as it scales, balancing stability with innovation.  
Good architecture isn’t rigid; it adapts when it needs to, while protecting what should remain stable.

### 🧱 **Designing structures, not patches**  
…but always open to new ideas when they make the system stronger.
