I build internal platforms, backend services, and the foundations that keep products stable as they grow.
My work sits between architecture, development, and the operational decisions that make a system healthy over time.

At Append, I’m involved in identity, service orchestration, CI/CD, and the core platform layer that our products depend on.
I focus on clarity, maintainability, and long-term structure — keeping things simple enough to evolve, but solid enough to support real usage.

I pay attention to how systems behave under pressure, how teams interact with the code they inherit, and how small decisions accumulate into larger outcomes.
I try new ideas when they solve a real problem, but I avoid complexity for its own sake.

Right now, my focus is platform architecture and backend design — building a base that we can grow without losing stability.
