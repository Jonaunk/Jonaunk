### COO & Backend Engineer at **Append**

I spend most of my time building backend systems that are practical, scalable, and clear enough to grow without becoming chaotic.  
Most of my work involves **.NET**, **Node.js**, and **SQL Server**, but what interests me goes beyond the tools themselves.  
I’m drawn to the moment when an idea starts turning into architecture — when a problem stops being abstract and becomes shapeable, designable, and eventually real.

I pay close attention to how systems age, how teams interact with the structures they inherit, and how small early choices can determine whether something remains flexible or becomes a constraint years later.  
I enjoy working on the parts of software that most people don’t notice: the boundaries, the flows, the quiet pieces of logic that hold everything together when things get complex.

At Append, I’m helping shape our internal services, our Identity layer, and the foundations for the SaaS platforms we’re building.  
My role sits somewhere between engineering and long-term thinking: understanding what we need today, what we might need in a year, and how to design something that can support both without forcing premature complexity.

I value thoughtful engineering — not just clean code, but code that understands the problem it’s solving.  
I like designs that hold under pressure, that remain understandable even as they grow, and that leave enough room for creativity instead of locking things into rigid patterns.  
Good systems, to me, feel intentional: the result of decisions made with awareness, not just habits or shortcuts.

Creativity matters to me as much as structure.  
The best solutions often come from exploring unconventional ideas, rethinking assumptions, or noticing a simpler path that wasn’t obvious at first.  
I see engineering as a mix of reasoning, intuition, and the willingness to rethink a design when the context changes.

Right now, my focus is on backend and platform architecture — building the foundations that will support Append as it scales, and finding the balance between stability, flexibility, and innovation.  
Good architecture, in my view, isn’t rigid. It adapts when it needs to, but it also protects what should remain stable.

🧱 **Designing structures, not patches** — while staying open to new ideas when they make the system stronger.
