## 🧩 COO & Backend Engineer at **Append**

I spend most of my time building backend systems that actually hold up in real conditions — systems that can grow without turning into a mess.  
Most of my day-to-day work involves **.NET**, **Node.js**, and **SQL Server**, but what interests me goes beyond the stack.  
I’m drawn to the moment when an idea stops being abstract and becomes something you can shape, adjust, and eventually rely on.

> I care about *why* a design works, not just *how* to implement it.

## 🛠️ What I’m building

At Append, I usually work on the parts you don’t see on the surface:

- our internal service layer  
- the Identity system  
- and the foundations for the SaaS platforms we’re building  

My role moves between hands-on engineering and long-term thinking —  
figuring out what we need now, what we’ll likely need later, and how to build something that doesn’t get in our way a year from now.

## 🎛️ How I approach systems

I pay attention to how systems evolve over time, how teams interact with what they inherit, and how early decisions quietly shape the future.  
I like working on boundaries, flows, and the small design choices that keep things stable when complexity increases.

> Good systems aren’t rigid or chaotic — they just make sense.

## 🎨 Structure + creativity

I care about structure, but I don’t believe everything has to follow the same pattern forever.  
Some of the best ideas show up when you question assumptions or try something that isn’t the obvious choice.

To me, engineering is a blend of logic, instinct, and knowing when to rethink a design instead of forcing it to fit.

## 🚧 Current focus

Right now, I’m working on backend and platform architecture — the pieces that will define how Append scales technically.  
I try to keep things stable without freezing them too early.

> Good architecture adapts when it needs to and stays firm where it matters.

### 🧱 **Designing structures, not patches**  
…but always willing to change things if it makes the system better.
